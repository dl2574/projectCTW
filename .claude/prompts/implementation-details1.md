1. The project currently allows users to create a generic user account. Users can use this account to create and upvote events. Events are implamented in a MVP fassion and need significant build out to complete.
2. There will eventually be 2 types of user accounts. Generic user, or business account. Generic users can create event proposals, upvote events and participate in event planning. Eventually I would like to implament a "level" system for users to rank up and get more permissions in the site as the participate in more and more events.
3. I have not determined how to calculate an upvote threshold yet.
4. Once an event has moved to the planning stages, users will propose dates and upvote on those dates in a similar fassion that users propose events and upvote events. These dates will only be able to be voted on by users who have upvoted the event and shown interest in participating.
5. I currently would like to rework the design of the site. I am not a greate designer yet and need help coming up with a design scheme I can use tailwind 4.1 to implament site wide. The site is currently live at www.projectctw.com but it needs significant work. I am not apposed to a complete redesign.

## Additional Details
- This project is a django project
- I am using tailwind 4.1 for styling
- I am using HTMX and alpine.js for scripting
