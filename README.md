## About

**ProjectCTW** (Project Change The World) is a web platform that enables community members to collaboratively improve their neighborhoods through volunteer events. Users can propose project ideas, vote on proposals they support, coordinate event details, and build verified volunteer resumes.

### The Workflow

1. **Propose** - Community members propose volunteer project ideas (e.g., park cleanup, community garden, playground repair)
2. **Vote** - Users upvote proposals they want to participate in
3. **Plan** - Events with sufficient upvotes move to planning, where users coordinate dates, supplies, and logistics
4. **Execute** - Volunteers check in at events to verify attendance
5. **Complete** - Event summaries are generated and added to participants' volunteer resumes

### Vision

Starting as a pilot in Colorado Springs, CO, ProjectCTW aims to become a global platform for grassroots community improvement, eventually operating as a non-profit organization.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.14+ (required by Django 6.0)
- pip (Python package manager)
- Git
- Tailwind CSS standalone CLI
- PostgreSQL (optional, for production-like setup)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dl2574/projectCTW.git
   cd projectCTW
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment**

   ```bash
   # Linux/Mac
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate

   # Windows
   python -m venv .venv
   .venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set up environment variables**

   Create a `.env` file in the project root:

   ```env
   SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key-here
   DEBUG=True
   DATABASE_URL=           # Optional: leave empty to use SQLite
   RESEND_API_KEY=         # Optional: required only for sending real emails
   ```

   To generate a secure SECRET_KEY:
   ```bash
   python manage.py resetsecret
   ```

5. **Run database migrations**

   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

6. **Create a superuser**

   ```bash
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

   You'll be prompted for:
   - Email
   - Username
   - First name
   - Last name
   - Password

### Running the Application

You'll need two terminal windows:

**Terminal 1 - Django development server:**
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

**Terminal 2 - Tailwind CSS (watch mode):**
```bash
python manage.py tailwind -w
```

Access the application at `http://localhost:8000`

## Development

├── base/              # Core site functionality (home, about pages)
├── events/            # Event management (Event, Plan, ProposedDate, Comment, SupplyItem, SupplyCommitment, AttendanceCommitment)
├── userProfile/       # Custom User model and profiles
├── notifications/     # Notification system
├── projectCTW/        # Django project settings

├── manage.py          # Django management script
└── requirements.txt   # Python dependencies
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
python manage.py test

# Run tests for a specific app
python manage.py test events

# Run a specific test file
python manage.py test events.tests.test_models

# Run a specific test class
python manage.py test events.tests.test_models.EventTests
```

**Note**: We're actively expanding test coverage. Contributions of tests are highly valued!

### Common Commands

**Database:**
```bash
python manage.py makemigrations  # Create new migrations
python manage.py migrate         # Apply migrations
```

**Static Files:**
```bash
python manage.py tailwind -w     # Watch mode (development)
python manage.py tailwind -d     # Deploy mode (minified, production-ready)
python manage.py collectstatic   # Collect static files
```

**Utilities:**
```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser # Create admin user
python manage.py resetsecret     # Generate new SECRET_KEY in .env
```

### Important Notes

- **Tailwind 4.x**: This project uses Tailwind CSS 4.x via the standalone CLI (NOT npm/npx). Tailwind 4.x has breaking changes from 3.x - always reference the [Tailwind 4.x documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs).

- **Custom User Model**: This project uses a custom User model (`userProfile.User`) with email-based authentication and UUID primary keys. Always use `get_user_model()` instead of importing User directly.

- **Environment Variables**: Never commit `.env` files or secrets. Use environment variables for all sensitive configuration.

---

## Deployment

### CI/CD Pipeline

- **Development Branch** → Merge to `main` after testing
- **Main Branch** → Triggers GitHub Actions
- **GitHub Actions** → Runs tests
- **Railway** → Auto-deploys if tests pass

Production URL: [www.projectctw.com](https://www.projectctw.com)

### Deployment Process

1. All development happens on the `development` branch
2. Create pull requests to merge into `main`
3. GitHub Actions runs the test suite
4. If tests pass, Railway automatically deploys to production
5. Database migrations run automatically via `Procfile`
