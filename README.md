## Description
The purpose of PrijectCTW is to provide a platform where community 
members can come together and improve their circumstances around 
them. Members of the playform can propose project ideas which
other members can vote on. If a project proposal gets enough upvotes,
it will move into a planning stage where the finer details can be
worked out. Once further details have been finalized, the project
will be scheduled for execution. The ProjectCTW platform will track
events which members create, plan, or attend and provide a volunteer
summary on request. 

Sample project ideas:
- Community park cleanup
- Plant a community garden
- Playground repair
